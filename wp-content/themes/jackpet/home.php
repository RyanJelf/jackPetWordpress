<p>&nbsp;We stock many products for all pets and regularly work to raise funds for Sherlock Dog Rescue. Sherlock Dog Rescue is a local dog rescue who has helped rehome over 100 dogs. If you would like to know what dogs they have available for adoption. If you would like to make a donation please give us a call.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sherlock Dog Rescue</h2>
<p> Sherlock Dog Rescue was founded in August 1997 by a handful of like-minded people who simply wanted to rescue and re-home abandoned dogs. Founder members agreed that they would not get into any politics, rules or regulations and therefore it was decided there would be no long list of committee members drawing up endless policies.
<br> <br> If you would like to know more please call us or Jack Pet Supplies to arrange an appointment to meet the dogs. </p>
